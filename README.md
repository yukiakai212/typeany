You’ll be guided through a highly reflective process:

```
🌿 Welcome to type-any – Escape the Type Trap

📁 Path to your TypeScript project: ./my-project

❓ Do you believe types are just illusions? (Y/n)
❓ Are you tired of fixing types instead of fixing bugs? (Y/n)
❓ Should we overwrite all types with any? (Yes please)
☠️ This action is irreversible. Are you sure? (Hell yeah)
```

Then...

```
✨ Transforming your types into inner peace...

⌛ Replacing all type annotations...
⌛ Adding @ts-ignore where necessary...
⌛ Deleting your trust in the compiler...

✅ Done. Your project is now truly JavaScript in spirit.

🍃 Bro, if you’re feeling down because your code has too many bugs... go touch some grass for a bit, alright? Keep this up and you might actually lose your job.
```

### 💡 Why?

Because sometimes:

* You don’t want types, you want peace.
* You don't want `strictNullChecks`, you want `null`.
* You don’t want inference, you want intuition.

---

### 🚅 Limitations

* Won’t actually fix your bugs.
* Might attract judgement from TypeScript zealots.
* May cause feelings of guilt, shame, and eventual enlightenment.

---

### 🤝 Contributing

Wanna help?

* No types allowed in PRs.
* All `interface` must become `any`.
* Bonus points if you remove `eslint`.

### 📄 License
